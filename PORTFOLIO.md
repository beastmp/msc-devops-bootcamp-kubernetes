# DevOps Bootcamp - Kubernetes

> This repository contains the Kubernetes deployment configurations for the CloudMart e-commerce platform, developed as part of the DevOps Bootcamp project.

## Background

The DevOps Bootcamp Kubernetes project provides the container orchestration layer for the CloudMart e-commerce application. It was created to demonstrate Kubernetes deployment strategies, service configuration, and cloud-native patterns that enable scalable, resilient application hosting.

## Approach

This project implements Kubernetes resources using a combination of YAML configurations and Terraform automation. Key technical approaches include:

- Defining deployment configurations for frontend and backend components
- Configuring services for internal and external traffic routing
- Setting up namespaces for logical separation of components
- Creating service accounts with appropriate permissions
- Implementing ConfigMaps and Secrets for configuration management
- Supporting load balancers for external access to services
- Automating Kubernetes resource creation with Terraform
- Designing for multi-cloud compatibility

The project follows Kubernetes best practices, organizing resources by component and providing clear documentation for deployment and management.

## Results

The Kubernetes deployment solution successfully provides:

1. Scalable hosting for CloudMart frontend and backend services
2. Load balancing for distributed traffic handling
3. Secrets management for secure configuration
4. Health checks and automated restarts for improved reliability
5. Integration with AWS EKS for managed Kubernetes
6. Standardized deployment patterns across environments

By implementing Kubernetes, the project enables consistent deployments across environments, simplified scaling, and improved resource utilization compared to traditional deployment methods.

## Next Steps

Future enhancements planned for the Kubernetes deployment include:

- Implementing horizontal pod autoscaling based on metrics
- Adding service mesh capabilities with Istio
- Enhancing monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana
- Implementing canary deployments for safer releases
- Adding Kubernetes operators for custom resource management
- Exploring GitOps workflows with tools like Flux or ArgoCD
